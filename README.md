#### Description:

The Student Registration System is a comprehensive platform designed to efficiently manage student data and course information within an educational institution. This system caters to the specific needs of administrators and users, offering distinct functionalities based on their roles.

### Roles:

**Admin Role:**
- **Course Management:** Admins have full control over courses offered. They can create new courses, update existing ones, or remove outdated courses from the system.
- **Student Management:** Complete oversight of student information, including adding new students, updating their details, or removing students who have completed their studies or are no longer active.
- **User Management:** Admins have the authority to manage user accounts, including granting or revoking access, setting permissions, and ensuring security within the system.

**User Role:**
- **Student Management:** Users with this role have limited access compared to admins. They can manage student information, such as adding new students, updating existing data, or removing students as necessary.

### Key Features:

- **Course Management:** This feature enables the addition, modification, and removal of courses offered by the institution. Admins can update course details, such as course names, codes, descriptions, and associated faculty.
- **Student Management:** The system stores comprehensive student data, including personal information, enrollment details, academic progress, and any other relevant information. Admins and users can efficiently handle student-related tasks.
- **User Access Control:** Admins hold the highest privileges and can manage user roles, ensuring that only authorized personnel access sensitive information.

### Why Use This System?

- **Efficiency:** Simplifies the administrative tasks related to student management, allowing for streamlined processes and reduced manual work.
- **Organization:** Centralizes student and course data, making it easily accessible and manageable for authorized users.
- **Security:** User roles and access control ensure data security and prevent unauthorized access to sensitive information.

This project aims to enhance the management of students and courses within an educational setting, providing a user-friendly interface for administrators and users alike.
